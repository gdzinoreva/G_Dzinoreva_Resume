	<a style = "display: inline;" href = "#navbar"> <em>(Back to home)</em> </a>
		<p style = "background-color: #F3E0DC">I am an Electronic Engineer and at present I am aspiring to be a Software Engineer attributed to my dynamic and ambitious nature, that or the fact that I have always been enthusiastic about 
		the software design and programming side of my Engineering discipline. I have made it my goal to purse Software Engineer or Developer route which goes to show just how passionate I am about the 
		Engineering field and its constantly changing Technologies. As evident in my work history further below this website I am a career-oriented and curious person, I strive to learn more,
		to better myself so i can give back better, to adapt in the face of change, innovate and excel in any given task or environment.<br><br>
		
		I generally admire hard-working people with great work ethics and I myself am often praised by my fellow team mates and management for my focus, diligence and resourcefulness in the work environment.
		Whether working on professional projects or any other tasks I apply to my best ability, logical reasoning and creative thinking, problem solving comes naturally to me. I also like to think I have 
		great team-work and leadership skills, I have sat on quite a number of committees mostly during my university days the notable ones being the Durban University International Students Committee
		and the Golden Key Executive Committee.<br><br>
		
		That's me in a tiny nutshell! My focus at the moment is on building the best Engineering career I can as a Software Engineer or as both Electronic and Software. I know I have so much to offer in the
		industry especially with the right opportunities.<br><br>
